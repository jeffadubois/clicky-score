This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To start the application execute  "yarn start"

After starting the application go to url http://localhost:3000/ in a browser.
Click on the images... The object of the game is not to click on an image that you have clicked on before.
With each click, the images shuffle into a different order to make it more difficult to remember what you have
already clicked on.
If you do happen to click on an image that you clicked on before, then the game is over.
You get a point each time you click on an image that you have not clicked on before.
See how many points you can get before the game ends!
